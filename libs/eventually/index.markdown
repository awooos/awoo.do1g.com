awooOS is built around an event-based architecture, using a library called
Eventually.

Even initializing the hardware abstraction layer is done via an event system.
This makes decoupling of components easier, so you can swap libraries in and
out for rapid experimentation.

[Eventually's source is available on GitHub.](https://github.com/awooos/eventually)
